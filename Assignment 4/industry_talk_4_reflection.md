After listening to the Technobizz Webinar by Dr. Seah, I realized that innovation plays a key role in improving human life by continuously identifying problems in the community and addressing them. This talk has motivated me to hone my entrepreneurial and innovative skills in order to be a pioneer in addressing the issues faced by society in the here and now using my knowledge in technology and information systems. Innovation is not limited to the technology sector. It can be applied to any field, including healthcare, education, and agriculture. Dr. Seah's talk has reminded me that being innovative is not just about having brilliant ideas, but also about being proactive in implementing them. With this in mind, I am committed to exploring opportunities to make a difference in my community and beyond. I believe that by working together and sharing our knowledge and expertise, we can make the world a better place for everyone.
