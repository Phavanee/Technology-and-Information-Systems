The PC Assembly lab was held on our very first class and included a hands-on PC assembly session as well as a short quiz after. The lab was fun and exciting for me, as it gave me a chance to familiarize myself with the contents of a PC. There were a few components that I have never handled before, such as the power supply box. I think this activity is a great way to get students enthusiastic about learning the components of a PC and engage with a PC assembly lesson, rather than a boring video. Overall, I think this activity should be a must in introductory computer classes.
