As someone with no background in programming, taking this course and picking an ICT pathway seemed daunting at first but I gained a lot of reassurance and motivation from this talk to keep pushing forward and stay curious. There were a lot of tips given, such as to attend online MOOCs and webinars to constantly upskill oneself, as well as to to seek out online resources as a way to stay on top of the industry. Knowing that in the future, even if technical jobs are not feasible for me, I could still work in IT related sectors as they are in high demand is also a relief for me. Overall this talk has been interesting, informative and motivating.
