To achieve a career in system development, Ms. Qistina Azam, a former UTM student explains her journey towards working in an analytics delivery team under Credence. She advises aspiring system developers to not stop learning and picking up new skills to develop themselves. One should keep brushing up on their weaker aspects, be it technical or theoretical. Doing this shows adaptability on your part. Even though there are many careers in the field of analytics, to be a system developer, one should be eager to learn and explore new things, learn to work in teams, build confidence and never give up. Overall, the talk was inspiring and gave me a clearer picture of how to become a system developer.
